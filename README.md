## Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. This repository provides:

- **Intent** of each pattern.
- **Class Diagrams** and **Sequence Diagrams** for visualization.
- **Code Implementations** in a clear and concise manner.
- Real-world **examples** to contextualize each pattern.
- Discussion on the **trade-offs** of each pattern.

## Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Implementation: Thread-safe Logger class.
2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - Example: Payment Processor for Net Banking and UPI.
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
   - Example: Computer Factory for Apple and Dell Computers.
4. **Builder Pattern**
   - Example: Document Builder for PDF and DOCX.
5. **Prototype Pattern**
   - Example: Army of Soldiers for cloning Basic and Advanced Soldiers.

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Example: Connecting to a Legacy Oracle DB using an adapter.
2. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Example: Coffee with Milk and Caramel decorators.
3. **Composite Pattern**
   - Example: File System with nested Files and Folders.
4. **Proxy Pattern**
   - Example: Lazy loading RealImage using a Proxy Image.
5. **Bridge Pattern**
   - Example: SQL and NoSQL Query Builders with MySQL and MongoDB.
6. **Facade Pattern**
   - Example: Payment Facade interacting with multiple services.
7. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - Example: Text Editor with Character Flyweight and Factory.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Example: Payment Methods in a Shopping Cart.
2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Example: WeatherStation notifying Displays and Apps.
3. **Template Method Pattern**
   - Example: Beverage Preparation with Coffee and Tea.
4. **Command Pattern**
   - Example: Text Editor with Bold, Italic, and Underline commands.
5. **Iterator Pattern**
   - Example: Forward and Backward iterators for Array Collections.
6. **State Pattern**
   - Example: Jira Tickets transitioning between states.
7. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - Example: Customer Support System with multiple handlers.
8. **Mediator Pattern**
   - Example: Form interactions using a Mediator.
9. **Memento Pattern**
   - Example: Document saving and restoring with Memento.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udaykirankavaturu/design-patterns.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Pattern**
   Each design pattern has its own folder with code implementations.

3. **Run the Code**
   Ensure your environment is set up to execute the C++ code.
